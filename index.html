        <p></p>
        I like to creep around my home and act like a goblin I don’t know why
        but I just enjoy doing this. Maybe it’s my way of dealing with stress or
        something but I just do it about once every week. Generally I’ll carry
        around a sack and creep around in a sort of crouch-walking position
        making goblin noises, then I’ll walk around my house and pick up various
        different “trinkets” and put them in my bag while saying stuff like
        “I’ll be having that” and laughing maniacally in my goblin voice
        (“trinkets” can include anything from shit I find on the ground to
        cutlery or other utensils). The other day I was talking with my
        neighbours and they mentioned hearing weird noises like what I wrote
        about and I was just internally screaming the entire conversation. I’m
        99% sure they don’t know it’s me but god that 1% chance is seriously
        weighing on my mind.

        <p></p> <p><h3>Jackdaws are not crows</h3></p>
        Here's the thing. You said a "jackdaw is a crow." Is it in the same
        family? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is a scientist who
        studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls
        jackdaws crows. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you
        shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying "crow
        family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which
        includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens. So your
        reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people "call
        the black ones crows?" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then,
        too. Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other,
        that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and
        a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a
        jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all
        members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays,
        ravens, and other birds crows, too. Which you said you don't. It's okay
        to just admit you're wrong, you know?

          alt="A normal farmer named joe" /> <p><h3>Who is Joe?</h3></p>
        <p></p>
        "Who’s joe?" a distant voice asks. Instantly everyone nearby hears the
        sound of 1,000s of bricks rapidly shuffling towards his location. The
        earth itself seemed to cry out in agony, until finally the ground itself
        split open and a horrific creature crawled from the ground, covered in
        mucus and tar. ”Joe Momma…” the creature whispered. The man cried out in
        pain as he disintegrated into dust, and the whole world fell silent in
        fear. "I did a little trolling." the wretched creature remarked before
        burrowing back into the earth.
